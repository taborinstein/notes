# Calculus II Day 1

## Sequences
- a list of numbers (terms, elements)
- Curly bracket syntax { }

1/n => asymptote at y=0, x axis
limit of func as x approaches inf => 0

- (Finite) sum => set number of terms
- (Infinite) series => infinite

```
          inf
{an}               => sequence of numbers a1 => ...
          n=1      
```
- there is no ainf! does not mean anything
- limit = inf? => no limit

(n+1)! / n!

(n+2)! => n!(n+1)(n+2)

n! cancels out => (n+1)(n+2) => always increasing when n > 0 so no limit
- **sequence has limit when approaches a fixed value**

Sigma => sum
```
 n
 âˆ‘  (1/2)^k
k=1
```
2nd term => 1/2 ^ 1 + 1/2 ^ 2
## Limit laws for sequences
<!-- where lim  -->
- lim n -> inf (an + bn) = A + B

lim 3 + lim 1/n = 3 + 0 = lim (3 + 1/n) = 3
