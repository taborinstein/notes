## Units:
**Physical Quantity**: Any number used to describe a physical quanitity
**Operational Definition**: Only can be described by how you measure them. (Must be calculated)
**Units**: A description of what you're measuring 
**Standards**: Natl Inst of Standards and Technology (NST) specifies which units correlate to what
**Systems of Units**: Intl System (SI sys, Metric sys), British System (Imperial)
- meter (m)
- kilogram (kg)
- second (s)
- ampere (A)
- ?
- mole (mol)
- candela (cd)
**Prefixes for Powers of 10**
- 10^-13 = fento (f)
- 10^-12 = pico (p)
- 10^-9 nano (n)
- 10^-6 micro (friction constant)
- 10^-3 milli (m)
- 10^-2 centi (c)
- 10^3 kilo (f)
- 10^6 mega (M)
- 10^8 giga (G)
- 10^12 tera (T)
- 10^15 peta (P)
**Mass**: Planck's constant

## Accuracy/Precision/etc.
**Accuracy**: How close the measured value is to the true value
- **True value**: Final result from measured value. In a perfect world, it can be found with infinite measurements.
**Precision**: How close measurements are to each other
- **Order of Significance**: 4.186 - 4 is most significant, 6 is least significant. If digits are changing and device is calibrated, only stable digits are significant
- Lead off zero is never significant but ones followed by another number is
- Scientific Notation - every number is significant
```
N = 1.682 x 10^7 <- base + exp
^
significand
    ^
    fractional coefficient
```
**Rounding**: NEVER round during calculation but ALWAYS at the end
**Mult/Div**: Find smallest amount of sig. digits. Final number must have that amount
**Add/Sub**: Use smallest sig. digits but use the largest when calculating, and use the leftover digits for rounding



# Homework
**What would be the radius of a sphere of this material that has a critical mass? Express your answer in centimeters.**

Sphere Mass is 60kg
Density = 19.5g/cm^3
Mass = Vol x Density
=> Vol = Mass / Density
Vol = 60 / 19.65 = 3.07692308cm^3
Vol = pi * r^2
r = sqrt(Vol / pi)
r = 0.989653998cm = 0.990cm

**With a wooden ruler, you measure the length of a rectangular piece of sheet metal to be 14 mm. With micrometer calipers, you measure the width of the rectangle to be 4.98 mm**
2 sigfigs (1 and 4 in 14)
- **What is the area?**
14mm * 4.98mm = 69.72mm^2
2 sigs => 69.|72mm^2 = 70mm^2 ?

- **What is the ratio of it's width to it's length?**
4.98 / 14 = 0.355714286
2 sigs => 0.35|571... => 0.36

- **What is it's perimeter?**
4.98 + 4.98 + 14 + 14 = 37.96mm
2 sigs => 37.|96mm = 38mm ?

- **What is the difference between it's length and width?**
14 - 4.98 = 9.02mm
2 sigs => 9.|02mm => 9mm ?

- **What is the ratio of the length to width?**
14 / 4.98 = 2.81124498
2 sigs => 2.8|1124... = 2.8 ?

**1.20**
- **How many times does a human heart beat during a lifetime?**
(I googled this and it's about 3 billion)
3 billion => 3 x 10^9

- **Gallons of blood? Use 50cm^3 per beat**
3 x 10^9
x 50 = 150 x 10^9 => 1.50 * 10^11
3785.41cm^3 per gallon
1.50 x 10^11 = 39628967.2gal
to sci => 3.96289672 x 10^7gal
1 sig = 3.|962... => 4 x 10^7gal
