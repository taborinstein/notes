# Notes
## Chapter 1
- UNITS!!! Always remember
- sigfigs 
Vectors: just need to know adding and subtracting vectors, plus dot product
- Addition: result vector always goes from tail of initial to tip of the final
- minus sign just flips the vector 180deg

## Chapter 2
Postion, displacement, average vel, instant vel, average accel, instant accel
- Position is just one point, displacement has a start and an end
- Average accel = (v2-v1)/t
- Speed has no direction
