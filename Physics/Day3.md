# Physics Day 3
## Homework in moodle

## Terms
- **Position**: Location of an object relative to the origin
- **Displacement**: Has both magnitude and direction 
- **Average Velocity**: Displacement over time
- **Average Speed**: Total distance traveled / total travel time


## Homework
**Starting from a pillar, you run a distance 200 m east (the +x-direction) at an average speed of 5.0 m/s, and then run a distance 280 m west at an average speed of 4.0 m/s to a post.**
- **Find average speed**
Total time: 200m/5.0ms + 280m/4.0ms = 40s + 70s = 110s
Total dist: 200m + 280m = 480m
Average speed: 480m/110s == 4.3636... == 4.4?

- **Find average velocity**
Total disp: 200 - 280 = 80m
80/110

**A Honda Civic travels in a straight line along a road. Its distance x from a stop sign is given as a function of time t by the equation x(t)=αt2−βt3, where α = 1.50 m/s2 and β = 0.0490 m/s3.**
nvm this one was easy

**Part C of that one question because i forgot to write it here**
0-2s = 4m
2-2.9s = 1.9 * -3 = -5.7
4 - 5.7 = -1.7m
(-1.7) / 2.9 =
