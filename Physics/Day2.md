## Vectors
**v** (bold) = v (with overline) = vector 
- Can add, subtract, and multiply, but not divide
- When subtracting, simply flip the second vec and add (A - B == A + (-B))
- Scalar is a number with a + or -
- Scalar x Vec changes length of vector, not direction. If it's -, it just flips the direction

## Components
A = ai + bj

For adding, simply add.

**Multiplying**:
Vectors are B and A, with some angle O between them
- Dot product = component method. 
**A** . **B** = B . A = ABcosO
When finding angle, always rotate counterclockwise
