One technology that led to the invention of gas lighting was Retorts, which are closed ovens that allow for the heating of materials without direct contact with a flame. Another was the gasometer, which allowed people to measure a volume of gas, which allowed them to know the amount of it if they knew the density.

One piece of knowledge that was used to pioneer gaslighting was deepened understanding of inflammable gasses, which do not contain carbonic acid. These were already known about but not heavily studied until the mid 18th century. Furthermore, the knowledge of how to use such gasses to generate light and heat was also important, involving using the products of them and combustible materials.
