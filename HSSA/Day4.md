# Day 4 (or maybe 5)
## Not Homework
**Cloth**
- Very expensive to make by hand bc very difficult and time consuming
- Hand weavers make a ton of money bc thread is so cheap
    - Once it becomes automated, they are out of jobs
        - Under general "Ned Ludd" (may or may not exist) they smash automatic looms + etc, which becomes a federal offense
- Color exists, apparently
    - Bleach arose from need for white linen
    - Black color comes from tar

## Homework
1. A block is a casing in which a pulley is mounted, so it mantains rigidity and does not break
2. The British government needed so many blocks because they were used intensively in sailing ships for tasks such as managing sails and raising guns. To quote, a "74-gun ship of the Royal Navy required about 1,000 blocks"
3. Originally, blocks were made by hand using typical woodworking tools. The only machine used in their construction was a treadle (lathe). Handmade blocks weren't as sturdy as the manufactured ones and weren't as uniform, which caused problems.
4. A lot of the wood was imported from Scandanavia, Russia, and North America, especially in England where deforestation resulted in a wood scarcity. Unfortunately, the importance of imported wood made it quite expensive, so for most things England used other materials such as stone or metal.
