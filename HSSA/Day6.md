1. Hides?
2. Also Hides??? It's the only thing I could find

4. The sailors think this in comparison to smaller ships who have been on the water for several years. Since their ship is bigger and holds more cargo, they are worried it will take them even longer.
5. It's hard to tell but I think his views are mostly negative. Dana describes the tools used by them (e.g. the oxcarts) large and clumsy, conveying that they are less refined than the sailors. Furthermore, later on the captain describes manually carrying things up a hill was "California fashion," suggesting they are primitive and crude.
6. From the depictions of him, the captain is very rigorous and expects a lot from the other sailors. Dana recalls not seeing him much, as the captain was always hard at work, and also describes him as a "man of steel." Dana describes the length of te voyage contributing to the need for discipline in the captain's eyes.
