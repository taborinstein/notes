## Homework
(I am not super sure on these answers but this topic is really interesting)
1. The water, and therefore the ice, is a blue-green color, probably as a result from minerals. From what I could tell, this "blue ice" melted much slower than regular ice, and therefore could be used to build things (?)
2. The people cutting the ice arrived on sleds and horses
3. The obtained ice was stored in big piles, and transported around the world to places such as the southern US and India.
