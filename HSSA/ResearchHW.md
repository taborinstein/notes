# Topic: Mechanization/Automation
# Part 1
## Assembly line
Before - Craftsmen would just make things individually  
Division of labor arose in china as a means of mass production  
Venitian Arsenal (google this later) was one of the first processes in europe to use the assembly line method of production  
### Industrial Revolution
(this is when mechanization took off)  
Steam engine arose in early 18th century (background knowledge)  
Material handling arose around this time (Source B) 
- ^ can go into depth on this, actually quite cool  
Oliver Evan's flour mill (read up on this guy), 1785, start of bulk material handling; made flour completely automated (this is cool), used a series of conveyors (Source C)  


The history of mechanization during the Industrial Revolution
# Key terms to take note of
Assembly Line (for history; a good starting spot to measure the need for automation) - Source A  
Oliver Evans (cool guy; I think this guy is another good starting point, as he was kind of a pioneer in this field, even making his own automobile) - Source C 
Material Handling (The transport and processing of materials in a manufacturing process. One of the first reports of automated mills mention this, so I want to look at it) - Source A, Source B  
Mills (Places that make things like flour, grains, etc.. I don't need to cover the entire history, per say, but when the mills start becoming fully autonomouse should be important) - Source A, but will definitely find more later on 
Henry Ford (important; Really a pioneer in the world of mechanization - needs no introduction) - Source D   
Pulley Blocks (a product that was mass produced. Feels important) - Source A    
Automobile Production (very cool - One of the most imporatnt instances of mechanization. This is definitely worth focusing on) - Source A   
Steam Power (early method of making an engine, which drove mills, factories, etc.) - Source E, but will find others  
WWII (also neat in terms of production - WWII saw a spike in the need for mass produced goods. This kind of pushed the assembly like/mass production towards being more mechanized) - Source F  
Railroads maybe? (Helped with material processing by ensuring safe and speedy transport of materials) - Source G

# Notes after meeting
-> focus on grain, flour, etc.
look at mineapolis museum website, could have interesting dates, people, etc.
pick spot in timeline, work way out from there
don't work on multiple parts at once, focus on one
