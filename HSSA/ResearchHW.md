# Topic: Mechanization/Automation
# Part 1
## Assembly line
Before - Craftsmen would just make things individually  
Division of labor arose in china as a means of mass production  
Venitian Arsenal (google this later) was one of the first processes in europe to use the assembly line method of production  
### Industrial Revolution
(this is when mechanization took off)  
Steam engine arose in early 18th century (background knowledge)  
Material handling arose around this time (Source B) 
- ^ can go into depth on this, actually quite cool  
Oliver Evan's flour mill (read up on this guy), 1785, start of bulk material handling; made flour completely automated (this is cool), used a series of conveyors (Source C)  


The history of mechanization during the Industrial Revolution
# Key terms to take note of
Assembly Line (for history; a good starting spot to measure the need for automation) - Source A  
Oliver Evans (cool guy; I think this guy is another good starting point, as he was kind of a pioneer in this field, even making his own automobile) - Source C 
Material Handling (The transport and processing of materials in a manufacturing process. One of the first reports of automated mills mention this, so I want to look at it) - Source A, Source B  
Mills (Places that make things like flour, grains, etc.. I don't need to cover the entire history, per say, but when the mills start becoming fully autonomouse should be important) - Source A, but will definitely find more later on 
Henry Ford (important; Really a pioneer in the world of mechanization - needs no introduction) - Source D   
Pulley Blocks (a product that was mass produced. Feels important) - Source A    
Automobile Production (very cool - One of the most imporatnt instances of mechanization. This is definitely worth focusing on) - Source A   
Steam Power (early method of making an engine, which drove mills, factories, etc.) - Source E, but will find others  
WWII (also neat in terms of production - WWII saw a spike in the need for mass produced goods. This kind of pushed the assembly like/mass production towards being more mechanized) - Source F  
Railroads maybe? (Helped with material processing by ensuring safe and speedy transport of materials) - Source G
