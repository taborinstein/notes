# Week 1
## Philosophy
- Question Everything
- Data drives everything
    - "Concepts" come from data, not rules
- No wrong answers, only bad data or flawed interpretations/conclusions

## Goals
1. Develop standard experimental practice/skills
    - Learn how to collect data
    - Learn how to document it
2. Learn fundemental principles of physics through observation
    - Align material with lecture
    - Interpret results of experiments with basis from lecture knowledge
3. Teach you how to interpret data, both for specific end points and deeper understandings of matter, life, universe
    - Analyze data appropriately
    - Uncertainty analysis
4. Effectively communicate findings using standards from the scientific + engineering disciplines
    - Write lab reports

## Requirements
- Attendance is mandatory
- Lab notebook
- Turn in lab report 1 week after lab is done
- Graded notebooks will be returned at the end of lab meeting
- Labs are 100 points. Lab reports are 95

## Reports
- 5 sections
    - Abstract
        - what, why, how
    - Theory
    - Procedure + Data
        - Drawings + lab notes
        - Describe procedures that aren't in the manual
        - Collect all data and tabulate
    - Analysis
        - Calculations
        - Plot data
        - Include data + error analysis - with examples and explanations
        - Discuss what results mean
    - Conclusions
        - Explain findings and if you have met the expected results within the uncertainty

## Error
- Uncertainty is error in measurement due to imperfect or unknown information
- NEVER only take one measurement
- Use standard deviation (google me)
- Standard error (NOT stderr) = SD/sqrt(n) = how far is mean from "true value"
- Propagate errors - google me
